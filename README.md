# Layout_Command_Control_Arduino_Nano

As part of my YoTube channel I am investigating using LCC for my lofta layout. This will be using some of the built in examples available from the Arduino IDE library manager.

At first I hope to be using the MERG CANUSB4 to connect the units to the CAN bus.

**Please use the Wiki tab as that will be used rather than this readme.
