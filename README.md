# Layout_Command_Control_Arduino_Nano

As part of my YouTube channel I am investigating using LCC for my loft layout. This will be using some of the built in examples available from the Arduino IDE library manager.

At first I hope to be using the MERG CANUSB4 to connect the units to the CAN bus. I will also investigate other alternatives units.
